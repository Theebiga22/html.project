    I will begin by discussing the key technologies and programming languages used in full stack web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and various front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. I will then move on to discuss the server-side technologies like Python, Java and Node Js, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Aws.

    <p>In this video, I will explain what full stack development is and provide a detailed overview of the technologies used to build full stack web applications. Full stack web development involves building the front-end, back-end, and database components of a web application. This means that full stack developers are responsible for everything from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic and database.</p>
